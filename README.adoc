| DESCRIPTION: | The source code consists of a library of our framework and
implementation details of the biped models in Mathematica.

| SIZE: | 20.1 MB

| PLATFORM: a| 
.All platforms supporting
* Mathematica v11+
* A Mathematica-compatible compiler
* _[optional]_ {matex}

| ENVIRONMENT: a|
.Test configuration
* Mathematica v11.3.0
* C compiler
  **  gcc 7.4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04
  **  Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10
* link:https://github.com/szhorvat/MaTeX/releases/tag/v1.7.5[MaTeX v1.7.5]

|===

=== Detailed Set-up Instructions

. Install Mathematica
. In Mathematica, configure a C compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, gcc, etc.)
. _[optional]_ To compute the plots in the paper, install {matex}

NOTE: {installer} provides a detailed installation checklist and can automate many of these steps.

=== Detailed Run Instructions

.To generate gaits from equilibria for various biped models from a single notebook:
. Open {launcher}
. Evaluate all cells
. Click on buttons in output cells

Clicking on a button will open and evaluate all cells of the model's corresponding Main.nb notebook. 

.To learn more about a particular model:
. Go to {models} and select a {models_name} folder (e.g., {cgw})

. Open Main.nb (e.g., {cgw_main}) and evaluate cells in order of appearance

. Browse other files in the subfolder (e.g., {cgw_model} contains the modeling
code for the compass gait)

NOTE: Most warnings generated in a Main.nb notebook can be ignored.  For example,
warnings that appear while compiling a model down to C code.

=== Output Description

While running Main.nb in {models_name}, the expected output is to see
animations of an example walking gait in certain output cells of the notebook.
For example, {cgw_main} has six (6) output cells with gait animations.

=== Major Component Description

The files {installer} and {launcher} automate the process of installing
packages and running models, respectively.  These are good places to start
before doing a deep dive into the code.

The folders {models} and {simple} contain software for generating gaits using
equilibria of a biped model as outlined in <<inprep>>.

The {models} folder contains a set of representative biped models found in the
literature.  The models are stored in their own subfolders.  Each folder has a
similar layout (e.g., each folder has a Main.nb, which generates gaits for that
particular model).  For making your own models, the folder {cgw} is a good
place to start.  Other models demonstrate our approach for generating, for
example, gaits subject to virtual holonomic constraints, multiple switching
times, or higher-dimensional manifolds.  See <<#tables>> for run times of a
particular model's Main.nb notebook.

The {simple} folder contains an implementation of our framework.  The code in
this folder is part of a larger effort to create a fast and expressive rigid
body dynamics' library.  We do not cover the files in depth except to point out
that {continuation} is where our numerical continuation library is stored and
{locomotion} is where many of the helper functions are defined for the bipeds
in the {models} folder.

ifdef::html_compact[See <<repo>> for more information on the {bipeds} folder.]

[#nodejs-dataset]
== Node.js Dataset

ifdef::html_compact[] 
While the Mathematica library has some basic gait animation features, we
provide a separate gait animation library that runs in a web browser for
advanced CAD rendering of the 3D models as seen in <<inprep>>.  For more
information, visit the online repository <<repo>>.

.To install the Node.js library
. Open {installer}
. Execute the cells related to downloading pre-compiled libraries of the web
app or for installing the source code.

Alternatively, clone or download the repository <<repo>>.

| DESCRIPTION: | A gait animation library in Node.js for animating and creating
video clips of generated gaits in a web browser.

| SIZE: | 161 MB

| PLATFORM: a| 
.All platforms supporting
* Node.js v12+
* A modern web browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) capable of running
** ECMAScript 2015 (specifically JavaScript)
** link:https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Browser-support[WebGL and Three.js]

| ENVIRONMENT: a|
.Test configuration
* Node.js v12.17.0
* Firefox 76.0.1

|===

=== Detailed Set-up Instructions

. Install link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js]

. In a command line terminal 
    .. Change into {bipeds}
    .. Run `npm install` from the terminal
    .. Run `npm run build`

. _[optional]_ Install a modern web browser; make sure it is your default browser

NOTE: Many of these steps are automated in {installer}.  Alternatively, you can
download pre-compiled binaries from <<repo>> without installing Node.js or the
source code.

=== Detailed Run Instructions

.To run the Node.js visualization library:
. In a command line terminal 
    .. Change into {bipeds}
    .. Run `npm run app`

=== Output Description
After successfully executing `npm run app`, your default web browser will
launch and show an animation of a biped robot walking.  The gaits of other
models can be selected from the drop-down menu.  When saving images or a video
`@nn`, where `n` is an integer, can be used to specify a frame rate in the # of
images textbox.  Images and videos are saved to {bipeds_imgs} and
{bipeds_vids}, respectively.  These folders are created as necessary.

=== Major Component Description

The {bipeds} folder contains code to animate advanced rendering models of the 3D
bipeds.  The library is capable of animating 2D and 3D gaits in a web browser
and producing video clips of a particular gait.  A secondary use of the {bipeds}
folder is to reproduce the video clips in {video}.

All code executed in Mathematica v11.3.0 with a gcc 7.4.0 compiler backend on a
2.7 GHz Intel Core i7-4800MQ CPU laptop running 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

NOTE: The compiled models are automatically saved after the first run and you
have the option to save and reload the generated gaits.  Saving the compiled
functions and generated gaits will significantly reduce the start-up cost of
future sessions.
